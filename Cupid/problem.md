# Cupid
My first is in SATCHEL and also in CLOUD.
My second's in LOVEBUG as well as in PROUD.
My third is in VIPER and PAVEMENT and VAMP.
My fourth is in PIRATE but never in TRAMP.
My fifth is in WORLDLY and also in DREAM;
My whole is a figure who fits today's theme.

If you thought that this poem was easy for you,
go through it once more; there's not one word, but two.
